    "## Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Life and physical scientists increasingly use big and complex datasets to answer questions about society and the natural world. In this course, students will develop introductory programming knowledge and data acumen to explore topics drawn from biology, chemistry, physics, and psychology. Students will learn to create and run computer programs, organize ideas using data to communicate clearly to others, break a complex problem into simpler parts, apply general data science principles to specific cases, distinguish causation from correlation and coincidence, and negotiate tradeoffs between different computational and statistical approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this course, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write computer programs in Python to prepare data for statistical analyses and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write computer programs in Python to conduct a variety of statistical analyses using Python and provide an oral and written interpretation of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify appropriate uses of computational and statistical methods to answer scientific questions, including their strengths and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clearly communicate the results of a data analysis to both technical and non-technical audiences.\n",

    "### Weekly Lab and Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "Each week (except the week of the midterm and final week of class), you will attend your lab section and complete assigned homework exercises for the week. There will be 10 labs and homeworks in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lab, you'll be able to work with your classmates and your TA to practice and apply the knowledge and skills introduced in that week's lecture. The overall purpose of the labs is for you to gain experience using Python in a Jupyter notebook to compute and visualize data under the guidance of a teaching assistant. Labs will be designed to help you review course material and get started on the weekly homework exercises. While lab attendance is not graded, we consider lab attendance to be **mandatory**, so please make sure that you prioritize attendance so that you can work through the labs with your TA alongside your classmates.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll then have additional time after the lab to complete your assigned homework, and submit it by Tuesday at 11:59pm the following week. Your submitted homework will be graded both by TAs and by automated tests to check the correctness of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: to give you flexibility throughout the semester, your two lowest homework grades will be dropped. This includes dropping grades of 0 when you do not submit a weekly homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Midterm Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The midterm test will be completed in-person on computers in the BCIT labs during regular class time.  You will have access to Jupyter Hub, MarkUs and course notes, but no other materials during the test. More details about the midterm will be posted closer to the date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The final project will involve students using data science methodologies to explore a scientific question, and communicate the results. A project proposal will be due on March 9, and the final project will be due on April 2. One of the goals of the project proposal is to give you feedback that can be incorporated into your final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Exam\n",
    "\n",
    "The final exam will be held in-person, scheduled by the Faculty of Arts & Science. For more information on final exams, please see the FAS [Exams & Assessments](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/faculty-registrar/exams-assessments) webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Missed Assessments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weekly Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "Late weekly homework assignments will not be accepted for any reason, since we plan to post answers soon after the due date.  If you do not submit a homework by the deadline then your grade on will be 0. NB: the two lowest lab and homework will be excluded when calculating your final grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Midterm Test\n",
    "\n",
    "If you miss the midterm for any reason then you will have an opportunity to write a makeup midterm sometime during the same week (i.e., on or before February 13). If you miss both the scheduled midterm and the makeup midterm then you will receive a 0 for the midterm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Late project proposals will not be accepted. Late final projects will be accepted upto 24 hours after the deadline, but there will be a penalty of 10%.\n",
    "<!-- For example, if the proposal is submitted on March 11 at 00:01 then 20% will be deducted, and if it's submitted March 12 then 20% will be deducted from your project proposal grade.  -->\n",
    "If you submit a late proposal then the teaching team cannot guarantee feedback in a timely fashion which means that you may have less time to incorporate your feedback into your final submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Exam\n",
    "\n",
    "For information on final exam absences and deferral requests, please consult the [Faculty of Arts and Science website](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/faculty-registrar/exams-assessments).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Marking Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "Any requests to have an assessment remarked must contain a written justification for consideration. Marking requests should be made within one week of receiving your assessment. *Please note* that we reserve the right to reconsider the marking of every question on your assessment when you re-submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to communicate with your instructors\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions about course material or organization, such as,\n",
    "\n",
    "- What do I change the colour of my plotting symbol?\n",
    "- How do I do question 3?\n",
    "- When is the term test?\n",
    "\n",
    "should be posted on the discussion forum (Piazza) or asked in person. Questions can be posted anonymously (so that the author is anonymous to other students but not to the instructors), if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your communication is private, such as, I missed the test because I was ill, then e-mail your instructor. Use your utoronto.ca e-mail account to ensure that your message doesn’t automatically go to a Junk folder and include your full name and student number.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use of ChatGPT / Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Students may use artificial intelligence tools for creating an outline for an assignment, but the final submitted assignment must be original work produced by the individual student alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Academic Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "You are responsible for knowing the content of the [University of Toronto’s Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters](http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, we encourage you to discuss course material with each other and ask others for advice. However, it is not permitted to share complete solutions or to directly share code for anything that is to be handed in. When an assignment is required to be completed as a team, you may share solutions and code with other members of your team, but not with another team in the class. For example, “For question 2 what Python function did you use?” is a fair question; “Please show me your Python code for question 2” is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions about what is or is not permitted in this course, please do not hesitate to contact your instructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessibility Needs\n",
    "\n",
    "The University of Toronto is committed to accessibility. If you require accommodations for a disability, or have any accessibility concerns about the course, the class room, or course materials, please contact Accessibility Services as soon as possible: <mailto:accessibility.services@utoronto.ca> or <https://accessibility.utoronto.ca>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Responsibilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is designed to actively engage you in the course material. We hope you’ll find this course on computation and data science interesting, challenging, and fun. In order for classroom sessions and labs to be effective, prepare by learning about the week's concepts by completing the recommended problems and readings.\n"
